# Business-glossary

### INTRODUCTION

Having Data is one thing but making good use of it, in using it to make good decision is another thing, here we have a company that has lots of Data but not making proper use of it, so here I had to build a business glossary, which is basically a central repository for the company, so they can start using their Data for making Data driven decision, cause if you’re not using your Data rightly, that means you’re using it wrongly, which can lead to financial, regulatory and also reputational risks.

### CHALLENEGES

•	We have not identified critical data items for quality monitoring. 
•	Data roles and responsibilities centrally and across the business are not clear.
•	We have lots of data but are not always making good use of its intelligence (e.g. customer data).
•	We do not have a clear sense of targeted business issues we need data to help resolve.
•	We do not have a clear set of data definitions or user requirements for improving the way data is presented.
•	Regulation and customer needs are changing, and we need to be able to respond to the demands externally and internally. 
•	Some foundations are needed before we can launch into predictive analytics. (Business Glossary)
•	We have not educated the business in the importance of data and so there is a lack of consistent knowledge.
•	Knowledge of data security risks and what to do about them is not front and center across the business.


### KPIs

•	100 % Identification of all critical data element 
•	100% data ownership
•	Defined roles and responsibility
•	Clear Data definitions without acronyms
•	Identified necessary data quality dimensions
•	Clear set rules of engagement.

### CONCEPTS DEMONSTRATED

•	Data gathering
•	Critical data element identification 
•	Data quality dimension threshold


 ### ACTION
 
Engaged with the stakeholders and heads of business units to Identify all the critical data element ( CDE) that are dependent on the success of the organization.
After identifying the CDEs, we went on to establish data ownerships, as every data requires a owner and steward, this is to ensure that every data set is properly managed, secured and of good quality. 
Set clear roles and responsibility to avoid over lapping.
Defined every data to ensure consistent understanding of each data set and maintains its context across different departments in the organization.
Created rules for every data set to guide the creation and usage of every data in the organization.
Also engage with the stakeholders to agree on the threshold for every data quality dimension. 

### CONCLUSION

The benefits of making data driven decisions in an organization cannot be over emphasized, it is a critical asset that drives informed decision making, operational efficiency and strategic growth within an organization. When properly managed, data helps every organization to identify its strengths and weakness, understand customer needs, measure performances and gain competitive advantage. It supports innovation, ensures regulatory compliance and foster a data-driven culture.
